            Act II: Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern's House
        </h5>

        <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  <p>Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
        experiment.</p>

        <h5>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <p>All such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p>

        <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>    <p>Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  If it wasn’t so,
        life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
        you should have told her years ago.</p>

        <h5>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <p>When?  When we were engaged?  Do you think she
        would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
        such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
        a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?</p>

        <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>    <p>[_Slowly_.]</p>  <p>Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There
        is no doubt of that.</p>

        <h5>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <p>[_Bitterly_.]</p>  <p>Men who every day do something of
        the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
        in their own lives.</p>

        <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>    <p>That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
        people’s secrets.  It distracts public attention from their own.</p>

        <h5>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <p>And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?  No
        one.</p>

        <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>    <p>[_Looking at him steadily_.]</p>  <p>Except yourself, Robert.</p>
