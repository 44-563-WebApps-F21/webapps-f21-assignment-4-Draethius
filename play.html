            Act II: Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern's House
        </h5>

        <h5 class="lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <p class="speech lordgoring">Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
        experiment.</p>

        <h5 class="sirrobert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <p class="speech sirrobert">All such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p>

        <h5 class="lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h5>    <p class="speech lordgoring">Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  If it wasn’t so,
        life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
        you should have told her years ago.</p>

        <h5 class="sirrobert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <p class="speech sirrobert">When?  When we were engaged?  Do you think she
        would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
        such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
        a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?</p>

        <h5 class="lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h5>    <p class="stage-direction">[_Slowly_.]</p>  <p class="speech lordgoring">Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There
        is no doubt of that.</p>

        <h5 class="sirrobert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <p class ="stage-direction">[_Bitterly_.]</p>  <p class="speech sirrobert">Men who every day do something of
        the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
        in their own lives.</p>

        <h5 class="lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h5>    <p class="speech lordgoring">That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
        people’s secrets.  It distracts public attention from their own.</p>

        <h5 class="sirrobert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <p class="speech sirrobert">And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?  No
        one.</p>

        <h5 class="lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h5>    <p class="stage-direction">[_Looking at him steadily_.]</p>  <p class="speech lordgoring">Except yourself, Robert.</p>
