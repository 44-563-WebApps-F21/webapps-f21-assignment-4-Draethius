        <p class="speech sirrobert">Of course I had private
        information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
        the day, and I acted on it.  Private information is practically the
        source of every large modern fortune.</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[_Tapping his boot with his cane_.]</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[_Pacing up and down the room_.]</p>  
        <p class="speech sirrobert">Arthur, do you
        think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up
        against me now?  Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be
        ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost?  I was twenty-two at the
        time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two
        unforgiveable things nowadays.  Is it fair that the folly, the sin of
        one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like
        mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have
        worked for, all that I have built up.  Is it fair, Arthur?</p>
